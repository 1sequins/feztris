# Feztris

### Overview

Experiment / 3D puzzle game using camera mechanic similar to Fez.  The project started out as a Mac game intended for Ouya, GameStick, etc. I grew tired of the slow pace and couldn't find a way to improve the experience, but Unity's free mobile license inspired me to give it one last shot on mobile.  It's more fun, but I've grown tired of it and decided to share.

Pardon the mess.

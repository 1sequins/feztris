# Feztris

### Overview

Experiment / 3D puzzle game using a camera mechanic inspired by Fez.  The project started out as a Mac game intended for Ouya, GameStick, etc. When I play tested the initial game modes with a PlayStation 3 Dual Shock controller the game felt a bit clunky and I couldn't find a way to improve the experience.

I left the project alone until Unity's free mobile licensing announcement inspired me to give it one last shot on Android and iOS.  The mobile build is more fun, but I think I'm done with this concept and thought I would share.

Pardon the mess.

Touch and [swipe similarly colored blocks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7X4KEylbpc) to match. A score multiplier kicks in when you match more than 3 blocks.  Swipe the sides of the screen to rotate the cube.


### Motivation

An excuse to develop in Unity while exploring a half-baked concept.
